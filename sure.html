    <div class="div">I added the lines but it wasnt looking gud so i removed em TVT [i acutually wanted add my voice (It dosent mean i can sing I actualy suck at singing but idk y I wanted to do tht TvT) instead of the original song but cuz of some issues I cudnt transfer the audio file TvT]<br> <br>
        <p>
            I used to think how can people get upset if someone dosent wants to talk to them, I mean they just talk to someone else.. until I found myself sitting on the bed thinking wht am I gonna do if I loose u? (the worst thing I cud ever imagine TvT).... <br>TBH my life was pretty boring thts y started playing therapy but u totally changed tht TvT, now Ik how it feels when someone makes your life better just by existing.... <br> Actually u completely changed me, I proggressed in academics, fitness, diet, I actually started taking care of myself after I met u.... <br> U just did smth tht completely made my life perfect... <br> Even this website which I made by coding, I left this skill 2yrs ago cuz I lost interest in everything and got pretty demotivated, And now as u can see I started again :3 <br>Thank you so much mam for entering my life :).... <br>And I really love u TvT <br> If u don't mind.. A virtual hug for u (づ ◕‿◕ )づ
